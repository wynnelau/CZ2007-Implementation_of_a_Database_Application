# CZ2007-Implementation_of_a_Database_Application

Group project done in Year 2 Sem 1

• Generated an entity relationship (ER) diagram and a normalised database schema to better understand the structure of the database.  
• Formulated SQL statements for queries using MS SQL Server to generate data required from the database.

### Lab 1: Create an ER diagram
- Based on information given, construct a suitable ER diagram.
- Analyse the usage of weak entity sets, choice of entity sets etc. and compare them with alternative solutions.

### Lab 3: Generate a Normalise Database Schema
- Ensure that the database is at least in 3rd Normal Form (3NF).
- For each relation, the key(s), primary key, and functional dependencies must be specified.
- If a relation is generated due to normalization of an original relation, then the normalization steps must be presented.

### Lab 5: Implementation of database schema
- The finalised database schema must be implemented using SQL DDL commands.
- Implementation should clearly incorporate the primary and foreign key, data types, integrity constraints, value-based and tuple-base constraints.
- Implementation obtained has to be extended by incorporating necessary constraints.
- In addition, formulate the SQL statements for the sample queries provided.
